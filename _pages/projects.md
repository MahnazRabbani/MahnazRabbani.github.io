Successfully managed and delivered multiple data science projects from conceptto implementation and
presentation, collaborating with cross‑functional teams, including data engineering, product manage‑
ment, and community management to drive business growth and improve decision‑making capabilities:
• Key Performance Indicator (KPI) projection
– Led, managed and executed the project for predicting key product metrics such as Daily Active Users
(DAU), Daily New Users (DNU), and purchases
– Utilized the Prophet package from Meta Research to model time series data of approximately one year
of KPIs and other significant features, such as the product event calendar
– Collaborated with data development and analysis teams to fetch and analyze data from multiple
sources and create a Tableau dashboard to present the results for internal clients.
• User retention analysis
– Performed statistical analysis to identify factors impacting customer retention and engagement to im‑
prove user experience and increase user retention
– Conducted thorough product research and collaborated with product designers to effectively define the
project and identify relevant features, leveraging their expertise in the domain.
• User churn prediction
– Successfully managed the project to implement personalized incentives for at‑risk customers, resulting
in a reduction in churn rate
– Developed and implemented the predictive model using machine learning techniques such as XGBoost
and LSTMs, as well as conducted an analysis to identify key factors contributing to churn.
• KPI calculator
– Developed an app using Streamlit that enables stakeholders to conduct simulations based on different
business scenarios and make informed decisions for future marketing and user acquisition campaigns
– Acting also as a product manager, I led and executed the project working closely with the internal client
to understand their needs and ensure a successful outcome.
• Customer lifetime value (LTV) prediction
– Developed a model to predict LTV using RFM (recency, frequency, monetary) and user engagement data
and XGBoost algorithm
– Predictions allowed stakeholders to make more informed business decisions and helped profile and
target users depending on their future lifetime value.
• User profiling
– Utilized KNN clustering algorithm to group and profile different cohorts of players based on engagement
and purchase data
– Analyzed characteristics of various user groups to gain valuable insights
– Used results as the foundation for additional projects and initiatives.
• Various ad‑hoc data analytic tasks
– Performed different data analysis and data engineering tasks to troubleshoot urgent issues.
